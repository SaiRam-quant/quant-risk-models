# 📊 Quantitative Risk Models by Sai Ram

Welcome! This repository contains practical risk models used in portfolio risk management, implemented using Python.

## 🧠 Project 1: Value at Risk (VaR) – Monte Carlo Simulation

This notebook estimates **1-day VaR** using a Monte Carlo approach:

- Simulates 100,000 possible daily returns
- Uses normal distribution based on daily mean and volatility
- Calculates **95% and 99% Value at Risk**
- Visualizes the simulated loss distribution with VaR markers

📁 File: `VaR_MonteCarlo_Sai.ipynb`

📈 Sample Output:
VaR 95% ≈ ₹34,010
VaR 99% ≈ ₹47,452
